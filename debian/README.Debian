gfarm for Debian
------------------

The pdiff command provided by gfarm source tar ball is not included in 
Debian package due to conflict with a2ps/pdiff task.

If you use MPI application on the Gfarm filesystem, you should compile
by /usr/bin/mpicc.mpich etc.

If you want to build with globus toolkit libraries as a static link,
try to debuild with '--set-envvar GFARM_CONFIGURE_OPTION=--with-globus-static'.
