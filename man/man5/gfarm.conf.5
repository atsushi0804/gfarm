.TH "GFARM.CONF" "5" "26 April 2003" "Gfarm" ""
.SH NAME
gfarm.conf \- Gfarm configuration file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
gfarm.conf is a text file that contains a Gfarm configuration.  
Gfarm server processes such as gfmd and gfsd refer to /etc/gfarm.conf
by default.  Since this configuration file is only read at the startup
time, it is necessary to restart servers when updating the content of
the configuration file.
.PP
Application programs such as gfls and gfhost refer to both
/etc/gfarm.conf and ~/.gfarmrc in a user's home directory as a
configuration file.  .gfarmrc has the same grammar as /etc/gfarm.conf.
If both .gfarmrc and /etc/gfarm.conf exist, .gfarmrc is read at
first.
.PP
Each line of gfarm.conf consists of one statement.  When the
line ends with the character ``\\'', the line continues for the next
line.  A word beginning with ``#'' causes that word and all remaining
characters on that line to be ignored.
.SH "HOST SPECIFICATION"
.PP
\fIHost specification\fR has the following
forms.
.TP
\fB\fIIII.JJJ.KKK.LLL\fB\fR
specifies an IP address with four octets from 0 to 255 separated
by ".".
.TP
\fB\fIIII.JJJ.KKK.LLL\fB/\fIMM\fB\fR
specifies a network address with an IP address and a netmask
from 0 to 31 separated by "/".
.TP
\fB\fIdomain.name\fB\fR
specifies a host name.
.TP
\fB.\fIdomain.name\fB\fR
specifies all hosts belonging to the domain.name.
.SH "STATEMENT"
.PP
The following statements are supported.
.TP
\fBspool \fIgfsd spool directory\fB\fR
The spool statement specifies a spool directory
for a Gfarm filesystem on this filesystem node.  On the filesystem
node, this statement should be specified.

For example,

.nf
	spool /var/spool/gfarm
.fi
.TP
\fBspool_serverport \fIgfsd port number\fB\fR
The spool_serverport statement specifies the tcp
and udp port number the gfsd is listening on.  The default port number
is 600.

For example,

.nf
	spool_serverport 600
.fi
.TP
\fBmetadb_serverhost \fIgfmd hostname\fB\fR
The metadb_serverhost statement specifies the
host name on which gfmd is running.

This statement cannot be omitted.

For example,

.nf
	metadb_serverhost ldap.example.com
.fi
.TP
\fBmetadb_serverport \fIgfmd port number\fB\fR
The metadb_serverport statement specifies the tcp
port number the gfsd is listening on.  The default port number is
601.

For example,

.nf
	metadb_serverport 601
.fi
.TP
\fBldap_serverhost \fILDAP server hostname\fB\fR
The ldap_serverhost statement specifies the host
name on which LDAP server for filesystem metadata is running.

This statement cannot be omitted.

For example,

.nf
	ldap_serverhost ldap.example.com
.fi
.TP
\fBldap_serverport \fILDAP server port number\fB\fR
The ldap_serverport statement specifies the tcp
port number of LDAP server.

This statement cannot be omitted in the current
implementation.

For example,

.nf
	ldap_serverport 389
.fi
.TP
\fBldap_base_dn \fILDAP_base_distinguished_name\fB\fR
The ldap_base_dn statement specifies the base
distinguished name of LDAP database.

This statement cannot be omitted.

For example,

.nf
	ldap_base_dn "dc=example, dc=com"
.fi
.TP
\fBauth \fIenable/disable\fB \fIauth method\fB \fIHost specification\fB\fR
This statement specifies the authentication method when
communicating with the host(s) specified by the third argument.

The first argument should be enable or
disable keyword.
The second argument \fIauth method\fR should be
gsi or sharedsecret keyword.
The third argument specifies the host(s) by \fIHost
specification\fR.

The auth statement may be specified any number of
times.  For each authentication method, it becomes a candidate when
the first entry whose host specification matches the target host has
the enable keyword.  When there is no corresponding
entry, or when the first corresponding entry has the
disable keyword, the authentication method does not
become a candidate.

This process takes place at both client and server sides.
Candidates for authentication method at both sides will be
tried.

The order of statements with different authentication methods is
not concerned.  When there are several candidates for authentication
method, sharedsecret is tried first, and then
gsi is tried.

The GSI authentication method is available if and only if the
--with-globus option is specified at the configure time.  When it is
not available, the auth statement with
gsi will be ignored.

This statement cannot be omitted.

For example,

.nf
	auth disable sharedsecret 192.168.0.100
	auth disable sharedsecret 192.168.0.101
	auth enable sharedsecret 192.168.0.0/24
	auth enable gsi ALL
.fi

In this example, all hosts belonging to the network address of
192.168.0.0/24 except two hosts of 192.168.0.100 and 192.168.0.101
will be tried to be authenticated by both sharedsecret
and gsi, and all other hosts will be authenticated by
gsi.  Note that two hosts of 192.168.0.100 and
192.168.0.101 will be tried to be authenticated by gsi only.
.TP
\fBnetparam\fIparameter\fB=\fIvalue\fB[\fIHost specification\fB]\fR
The netparam statement specifies several
communication parameters listed below.

parallel_streams.  This parameter specifies the
number of tcp streams.  The default is a single stream.  This
parameter may improve the file transfer performance especially when
connecting to a far distant site such that tcp congestion window size
will not increase enough.  In the current implementation, this
parameter is only effective on a client node where gfrep(1) command is
executed.  \fIHost specification\fR specifies the
source host(s) of file replication instead of the destination
host(s).

stripe_unit_size.  This parameter specifies how
to divide the data when utilizing multiple tcp streams.  Without this
parameter, the data will be divided into
parallel_streams of contiguous blocks with almost even
size.  When this parameter is specified, the data is divided in
round-robin fashion with the specified block size in byte.  Generally
speaking, the performance of file transfer is improved using this
parameter.

This parameter is effective only when two or more is specified
by the parallel_streams parameter.  In the current
implementation, this parameter is only effective on a client node
where gfrep(1) command is executed.  \fIHost
specification\fR specifies the source host(s) of file
replication instead of the destination host(s).

rate_limit.  This parameter specifies the maximum
transfer rate (bps; bit per second) for a single connection, which is
introduced experimentally.  In the current implementation, this
parameter is only effective on a client node where gfrep(1) command is
executed.  \fIHost specification\fR specifies the
source host(s) of file replication instead of the destination
host(s).

For example,

.nf
	netparam parallel_streams=2	10.0.0.0/8
	netparam stripe_unit_size=8192	10.0.0.0/8
	netparam rate_limit=750000	192.168.0.0/24
.fi
.TP
\fBsockopt \fIoption\fB[=\fIvalue\fB] [LISTENER | \fIHost specification\fB]\fR
The sockopt parameter specifies the socket option
\fIoption\fR via the setsockopt(2) system call.

When LISTENER is specified by the second
argument, the socket option is applied to the socket that listens to
irrespective of the target hosts.

When the host specification is specified by the second argument,
the socket option is applied to the socket that connects to hosts with
the corresponding host specification.

If the second argument is omitted, the socket option is applied
to every socket.

The following socket option can be specified.

debug.  SO_DEBUG socket
option is specified.  The \fIvalue\fR is not
necessary.

keepalive.  SO_KEEPALIVE
socket option is specified.  The \fIvalue\fR is not
necessary.

sndbuf.  SO_SNDBUF socket
option is specified with the \fIvalue\fR

rcvbuf.  SO_RCVBUF socket
option is specified with the \fIvalue\fR

tcp_nodelay.  TCP_NODELAY
socket option is specified.  The \fIvalue\fR is not
necessary.

For example,

.nf
	sockopt tcp_nodelay 192.168.0.0/24
	sockopt sndbuf=1048576 10.0.0.0/8
	sockopt sndbuf=1048576 LISTENER
	sockopt rcvbuf=1048576 10.0.0.0/8
	sockopt rcvbuf=1048576 LISTENER
.fi
.TP
\fBaddress_use \fIHost specification\fB\fR
The address_use statement specifies an IP address
or a network address that is preferably used for connection when the
target host has several IP addresses.

For example,

.nf
	address_use 192.168.0.0/24
.fi
.TP
\fBlocal_user_map \fIconfiguration of a file to map user name \fB\fR
This directive specifies a file name to map global user names
to local user names

This directive is optional. You can use this directive
to map user names on filesystem node hosts which use different
user account names for an identical user.
One can use gfarm as an identical user by defining a mapping from
an identical global user name to a local user name on each host
which has different UNIX account name.

Example:

.nf
	local_user_map /etc/gfarm/gfarm-usermap
.fi

Each line of the user mapping file is consisted of two fields,
first field is a global user name, and second field is a local user name,
and those fields are separated by spaces.

Example of the user mapping file:

.nf
	foobar foo
	quux baz
.fi

In the first line of this mapping file, a user name "foobar"
is defined as a global user name which corresponds to a local user
name "foo" on this node.
.SH "GRAMMAR"
.PP
This is a grammar of gfarm.conf described by the BNF
notation.
