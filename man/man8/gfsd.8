.SH NAME
gfsd(8) \- Gfarm filesystem daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfsd\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfsd\fR is a filesystem daemon for the Gfarm filesystem, which has
been running on every filesystem node, usually, with a root privilege.
.PP
\fBgfsd\fR provides remote file operations with access control in the
Gfarm filesystem as well as user authentication, file replication,
fast invocation, node resource status monitoring.
.PP
It is possible for \fBgfsd\fR to be executed as a non-privileged user
process although other users cannot use it.  Moreover, a \fBgfsd\fR
with a user privilege cannot authenticate using the GSI.
.PP
In order to execute \fBgfsd\fR as a non-privileged user process, a
configuration file for a user needs to be specified by the -f option.
At least, the port number used by \fBgfsd\fR should be altered to a
non-privileged port number by spool_serverport statement in the
configuration file or the -p option.
.PP
In this case, the altered port number of \fBgfsd\fR should be
specified by the spool_serverport statement in ~/.gfarmrc or
/etc/gfarm.conf on a client node.
