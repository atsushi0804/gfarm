.SH NAME
gfrun, gfrsh, gfssh \- run Gfarm parallel programs
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfrun\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] \fB\fIcommand\fB\fR \fB\fIarg\fB\fR\fI ...\fR


\fBgfrsh\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] \fB\fIcommand\fB\fR \fB\fIarg\fB\fR\fI ...\fR


\fBgfssh\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] \fB\fIcommand\fB\fR \fB\fIarg\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfrun\fR executes a parallel command on
filesystem nodes, which is determined by the -G option, the -H option,
or the -N option.
.PP
The -G option specifies the \fIgfarm-URL\fR,
which will be used by the file-affinity scheduling.  In this case,
\fBgfrun\fR schedules the same number of filesystem nodes
as the number of the Gfarm fragments, taking into consideration the
physical locations of each fragment replicas of the Gfarm file, and
filesystem node status.  The -H option specifies the
\fIhostfile\fR that lists filesystem nodes.  The -N
option specifies the number of filesystem nodes.
.PP
When none of -G, -H, and -N options are not specified,
\fBgfrun\fR schedules filesystem nodes by the
file-affinity scheduling using the first existent Gfarm file in the
argument list \fIargs\fR.  If there is no existent
Gfarm file in the argument list, an appropriate filesystem node is
selected to be executed.
.PP
\fBgfrsh\fR and \fBgfssh\fR utilizes
rsh and ssh, respectively, instead of gfrcmd.
.PP
\fICommand\fR can be specified by a gfarm-URL
that is registered using gfreg(1).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-G \fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR
specifies a Gfarm file \fIgfarm-URL\fR for file-affinity scheduling.
.TP
\fB-H \fIhostfile\fB\fR
specifies a \fIhostfile\fR that lists filesystem nodes.  If the -G
option is specified with the -H option, this option is ignored.

if ``-'' is specified, standard input is used to read the host list.
.TP
\fB-N \fInp\fB\fR
specifies the number of nodes \fInp\fR, which
are selected by the increasing order of load average.  If the -G
option or the -H option is specified with the -N option, this option
is ignored.
.TP
\fB-r\fR
specifies an on-demand replication mode.  In this mode, every
file will be replicated before it will be accessed remotely.
.TP
\fB-o \fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR
specifies a Gfarm file that the standard output of the executed
program will be redirected to.
.TP
\fB-e \fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR
specifies a Gfarm file that the standard error of the executed
program will be redirected to.
.TP
\fB-I \fIfragment-index\fB\fR
specifies a Gfarm fragment index executed by the gfrun command.
It is necessary that a parallel process will be scheduled by
file-affinity scheduling.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
displays error message verbosely.
.TP
\fB-p\fR
displays elapsed time of each Gfarm parallel I/O API after the
program terminates.
.TP
\fB-g\fR
explicitly specifies that the command is a Gfarm program.
Gfarm specific options will be passed to the command as the result.
.TP
\fB-u\fR
explicitly specifies that the command is an usual program, and
does not take Gfarm specific options.
.TP
\fB-?\fR
displays a list of command options.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
\fBGFRUN_CMD\fR
specifies a remote shell command.  If globus-job-run is specified,
gfrun executes each process using globus-job-run.
