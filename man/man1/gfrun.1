.SH NAME
gfrun, gfrsh, gfssh \- run Gfarm parallel programs
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgfrun\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] \fB\fIcommand\fB\fR \fB\fIarg\fB\fR\fI ...\fR


\fBgfrsh\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] \fB\fIcommand\fB\fR \fB\fIarg\fB\fR\fI ...\fR


\fBgfssh\fR [ \fB\fIoptions\fB\fR ] \fB\fIcommand\fB\fR \fB\fIarg\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfrun\fR executes a parallel command on
filesystem nodes, which is determined by the -G option, the -H option,
or the -N option.
.PP
The -G option specifies the \fIgfarm-URL\fR,
which will be used by the file-affinity scheduling.  In this case,
\fBgfrun\fR schedules the same number of filesystem nodes
as the number of the Gfarm fragments, taking into consideration the
physical locations of each fragment replicas of the Gfarm file, and
filesystem node status.  The -H option specifies the
\fIhostfile\fR that lists filesystem nodes.  The -N
option specifies the number of filesystem nodes.
.PP
When none of -G, -H, and -N options are not specified,
\fBgfrun\fR schedules filesystem nodes by the
file-affinity scheduling using the first existent Gfarm file in the
argument list \fIargs\fR.  If there is no existent
Gfarm file in the argument list, an appropriate filesystem node is
selected to be executed.
.PP
\fBgfrsh\fR and \fBgfssh\fR utilizes
rsh and ssh, respectively, instead of gfrcmd.
.PP
\fICommand\fR can be specified by a gfarm-URL
that is registered using gfreg(1).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-G \fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR
specifies a Gfarm file \fIgfarm-URL\fR for file-affinity scheduling.
.TP
\fB-H \fIhostfile\fB\fR
specifies a \fIhostfile\fR that lists filesystem nodes.  If the -G
option is specified with the -H option, this option is ignored.

if ``-'' is specified, standard input is used to read the host list.
.TP
\fB-N \fInp\fB\fR
specifies the number of nodes \fInp\fR, which
are selected by the increasing order of load average.  If the -G
option or the -H option is specified with the -N option, this option
is ignored.
.TP
\fB-o \fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR
specifies a Gfarm file that the standard output of the executed
program will be redirected to.
.TP
\fB-e \fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR
specifies a Gfarm file that the standard error of the executed
program will be redirected to.
.TP
\fB-?\fR
displays a list of command options.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
\fBGFRUN_CMD\fR
specifies a remote shell command.  If globus-job-run is specified,
gfrun executes each process using globus-job-run.
