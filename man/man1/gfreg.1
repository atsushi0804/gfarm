.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The first form copies and registers the
\fIprogram\fR as a Gfarm file
\fIgfarm-URL\fR in the Gfarm filesystem.  When
\fIgfarm-URL\fR is a directory, multiple programs
can be specified.  After the
registration, the \fIgfarm-URL\fR can be specified as
a program name of gfrun(1) and gfmpirun_p4(1).  Without the
\fB-a\fR option or the \fB-h\fR option,
architecture of the \fIprogram\fR is
assumed to be the same architecture as the client host on that
gfreg(1) is executed, which is obtained by the Gfarm metaserver.
.PP
The second form registers one or more
\fIlocalfile\fRs as a single Gfarm file.  The
destination filesystem node will be automatically selected by CPU load
average.  With the \fB-D\fR option, the selection of
filesystem nodes is limited in the specified domain name.
.PP
The third form registers \fIlocalfile\fR as a
file fragment of a Gfarm file.  The total number of fragments and the
fragment index are specified by the \fB-N\fR option and the
\fB-I\fR option, respectively.  When
\fIgfarm-URL\fR is a directory, multiple
\fIlocalfile\fRs can be specified.
The destination filesystem
node will be automatically decided by CPU load average except that the
\fB-h\fR option is explicitly specified.  When the gfreg
command of this form is executed on a filesystem node, the local
filesystem node is always selected rather than a remote filesystem
node.  In this case, the \fB-h\fR option helps to store
files dispersively.
.PP
The fourth form registers the \fIdirectory\fR
as a Gfarm directory \fIgfarm-URL\fR, the
\fIprogram\fR or the \fIlocalfile\fR
as a Gfarm file \fIgfarm-URL\fR.
If \fIdirectory\fR have some sub directories and/or
files, they will be registered recursively.  The non-executable file 
\fIlocalfile\fR will be registered as a file has
one fragment.  A non-executable file in the
\fIdirectory\fR will be registered in the same way.
When \fIgfarm-URL\fR already exists as a directory,
multiple \fIdirectorie\fRs,
\fIprogram\fRs, and \fIlocalfile\fRs
can be specified and they will be registered in
\fIgfarm-URL\fR.  They can be mixed in parameteres,
while other forms inhibit this manner.
When \fIgfarm-URL\fR already exists as a file,
one program or localfile can be specified and the content of
\fIgfarm-URL\fR will be replaced. 
If \fIgfarm-URL\fR does not exist, one
\fIdirectory\fR or one
\fIprogram\fR, or one
\fIlocalfile\fR can be specified and it will be
registered as \fIgfarm-URL\fR.
Refer to the first form's part above to specify filesystem node
thatprogfarms and files will reside with the \fB-a\fR
option or the \fB-h\fR option.
