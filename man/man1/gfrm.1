\fBgfrm\fR [ \fB-f\fR ] \fB-h \fIfilesystem-node\fB\fR \fB-I \fIfragment-index\fB\fR \fB\fIgfarm-URL\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfrm\fR removes each specified file.  By
default, it does not remove directories.  '.' or '..' cannot be
removed.  With the \fB-h\fR option,
\fBgfrm\fR removes file replicas of each specified file
on the specified filesystem node(s).  All file replicas of a file
cannot be removed.
.PP
When both \fB-h\fR and \fB-I\fR options are specified, \fBgfrm\fR
removes a file replica specified by \fIfragment-index\fR on the
filesystem nodes \fIfilesystem-node\fR.  All file
replicas of a file cannot be removed.
.SH "OPTIONS"
