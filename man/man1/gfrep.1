.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBgfrep\fR creates a replica of Gfarm files
specified by the \fIgfarm-URL\fR. 
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-H \fIhostfile\fB\fR
specifies a file which describes hostnames of
destination filesystem nodes where the replica will be made on.
The \fIhostfile\fR consists of a filesystem node name
in each line.
If the number of nodes listed in the \fIhostfile\fR
is less than the total number of file fragments,
it is treated as if the node names are specified repeatedly.

if ``-'' is specified, standard input is used to read the host list.
.TP
\fB-D \fIdomainname\fB\fR
specifies a domainname of destination filesystem nodes
where the replica will be made on.
.TP
\fB-P \fIhost-pair-file\fB\fR
specifies a file which describes hostname pairs of
source nodes and destination nodes.
The \fIhost-pair-file\fR consists of a pair
of a source node name and a destination node name in this order in each line.
The replica will be copied to the destination node, only if it exists
on the source node of the pair.
.TP
\fB-d \fIdestination-node\fB\fR
specifies one destination filesystem node where the file will be
copied to.
This option also needs \fB-I\fR usually,
but there are conditions that \fB-I\fR option can be omitted.
Please refer the description of the \fB-I\fR for detail.
.TP
\fB-s \fIsource-node\fB\fR
specifies a source filesystem node where the file will be copied from.
This option is used with the \fB-d\fR option.

If this option is omitted, the source filesystem node is choosed
automatically.
.TP
\fB-I \fIfragment-index\fB\fR
specifies a file fragment number,
if the \fIGfarm-URL\fR is an usual file.
If the \fIGfarm-URL\fR is a program,
this option specifies an architecture name of the program.
This option is used with the \fB-d\fR option.

It is possible to omit this option in the following cases.
If specified \fIGfarm-URL\fR is an usual file
and it's consists of just one file fragment, this option can
be omitted, and works as if option \fB-I 0\fR is specified.
If specified \fIGfarm-URL\fR is a program,
This works as if the architecture of the destination filesystem node
is specified.
.TP
\fB-?\fR
displays a list of command options.
