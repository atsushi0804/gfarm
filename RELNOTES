Release note for Gfarm 1.0b3
============================

[2003.8.20]

Updated Features

 * Client commands

   * New command

   - gfcd, gfpwd, gfmkdir, gfrmdir
   - gfront --- Gfarm file system browser.

   * New feature

   (gfrun)

   - Enhanced the host selection to schedule hosts which can run a
     specified program.
   - Added -u and -g options to manually decide to pass gfarm specific
     command-line options or not.
   - Added the -v option to display GSSAPI major and minor error
     status.
   - Added the -p option to profile Gfarm parallel I/O APIs.
   - Added the -r option for on-demand replication.
   - Added the -I option to specify an index name explicitly.  This
     option is effective only with the file-affinity scheduling.

   (gfhost)

   - Added a feature such that gfhost selects hosts that the user
     successfully logs on.

   (gfrep)

   - Supported a special case for replicating a Gfarm file with only
     one file fragment.  In this case, the file can be replicated by
     specifying only the -d option.

   (gfreg)

   - Added the -D <domain> option to limit filesystem nodes within the
     specified domainname.

   (gfsched)

   - Added the -p <program> option to restrict the selection of hosts
     that can run the specified program.
   - Added the -N <#nodes> option.
   - Added the -U option to retain old behavior (i.e. do not check
     whether the user can log in or not.)

   (gfrcmd)

   - Added a functionality to execute .bashrc at login time.
   - Added the -v option to display GSSAPI major and minor error
     status.

   (gfmpirun_p4)

   - Added -G <Gfarm file> and -N <# nodes> options.

 * Parallel I/O Library

   - [Fault tolerance] When a file to be opened is missing for some
     reason, try to open another file replica.
   - [Fault tolerance] Only filesystem nodes the user successfully
     logged on are selected by every command.
   - [Performance] Employed better process scheduling.
   - [Performance] Improved the overhead of GSI authentication and the
     performance of data transfer with GSI.
   - [New feature] Host alias name can be specified as a hostname.

 * Syscall hooking libraries

   - Added an entry to hook utime().

 * Configuration file

   - '*' can also be specified in a host specification part that means
     all hosts.  'ALL' will be deprecated.

 * Documentation

   (README.hook) Added a section for C++ programs.

   (INSTALL) Updated the description.

 * Bug fix

   (gfs_hook.o)

   - Fixed a bug when hooking lseek64 on linux.
   - Fixed a bug such that a Gfarm file is occasionally deleted.

   (libgfarm.a)

   - Added a missing error condition.
   - Fixed memory leak at LDAP access that is not described in
     RFC1823.
   - Fix an off-by-one error that may cause core dump.

   (gfsd)

   - Fixed a bug such that gfsd that executes a user process cannot
     terminate and consume 100% of CPU when the invoked gfrcmd is
     already terminated before that.

Release note for Gfarm 1.0b2
============================

[2003.5.19]

Updated Features

 * Client commands

   (gfreg) A new feature is added to register multiple local files.

   (gfrun) The executed process can be suspended or executed in the
           background.

   (gfrcmd) A delegated credential is exported to be delegated by a
            invoked child process by gfrcmd.

 * Servers (gfsd and gfmd)

   Information about authentication and disconnection is now logged.

 * Parallel I/O Library

   Only available filesystem nodes are selected by every command.
   Node selection algorithm by load average is improved.

   Flags, GFARM_FILE_REPLICATE and GFARM_FILE_NOT_REPLICATE, for
   gfs_pio_{open,create} and gfs_pio_set_view_{local,index,global} are
   implemented.

 * Documentation

   (README.hook) An example of static compilation with the Globus
                 library is added.

   (INSTALL, GUIDE) Examples of the gfreg command are updated.

   (Gfarm-FAQ) Deleted the item 2.1, and added a new item 2.1.

 * Bug fix

   (gfls) Changed an inappropriate error message from "not a
          directory" to "no fragment information".

   (gfrep) A bug of buffer overrun is fixed.

   (gfsd) Resource and memory leaks are plugged.

   (gfmd) Resource and memory leaks are plugged.
          A minor race condition is fixed.
          Fix a bug which made gfmd core dump at authentication failure.

Release note for Gfarm 1.0b1
============================

[2003.4.25]

Features

 * Supported client commands

   file management - gfls, gfreg, gfrep, gfrm, gfwhere
   file utilities  - gfexport, gfimport_text, gfimport_fixed
   scheduling & host management - gfsched, gfhost
   process management - gfrun, gfrcmd, gfmpirun_p4, gfps
   security - gfkey, digest

 * Unsupported client commands

   gfmkdir, gfrmdir,
   gfchmod, gfchown, gfchgrp,
   gfcd, gfchdir, gfpwd,
   gfcp, gfdf, gfsck.

 * Gfarm filesystem

   Gfarm filesystem supports a Gfarm file that is a group of ranked
   files.  Each file of a Gfarm file can be replicated and stored in
   any filesystem node.

 * Gfarm filesystem daemon (gfsd)

   Gfsd has a capability of remote file operations, user
   authentication, file replication, remote program invocation, and
   node status monitoring.

 * Gfarm job-management daemon (gfmd)

   Gfmd has a capability of job management for gfps.

 * Gfarm filesystem metadata daemon (slapd)

   This implementation utilizes the slapd provided by
   the OpenLDAP software.

 * Syscall hooking libraries

   Legacy applications can utilize a Gfarm filesystem just linking
   with syscall-hooking library, gfs_hook.o or gfs_hook_mpi.o.

 * Sample Gfarm parallel commands

   gfgrep    - parallel grep
   gfwc      - parallel word count
   gfcp      - parallel copy
   gfcombine - reduce the number of fragments by combining file fragments
