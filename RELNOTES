   (gfreg) A new feature is added to register multiple local files.

   (gfrun) The executed process can be suspended or executed in the
           background.

   (gfrcmd) A delegated credential is exported to be delegated by a

 * Servers (gfsd and gfmd)

   Information about authentication and disconnection is now logged.

 * Parallel I/O Library

   Only available filesystem nodes are selected by every command.
   Node selection algorithm by load average is improved.

   Flags, GFARM_FILE_REPLICATE and GFARM_FILE_NOT_REPLICATE, for
   gfs_pio_{open,create} and gfs_pio_set_view_{local,index,global} are
   implemented.

 * Bug fix

   (gfls) Changed an inappropriate error message from "not a
          directory" to "no fragment information".

   (gfrep) A bug of buffer overrun is fixed.

   (gfsd) Resource and memory leaks are plugged.

   (gfmd) Resource and memory leaks are plugged.
          A minor race condition is fixed.

   any filesystem node.

 * Gfarm filesystem daemon (gfsd)

   Gfsd has a capability of remote file operations, user
   authentication, file replication, remote program invocation, and
   node status monitoring.

 * Gfarm job-management daemon (gfmd)

 * Gfarm filesystem metadata daemon (slapd)

   This implementation utilizes the slapd provided by
   the OpenLDAP software.

 * Syscall hooking libraries

   Legacy applications can utilize a Gfarm filesystem just linking
   with syscall-hooking library, gfs_hook.o or gfs_hook_mpi.o.

 * Sample Gfarm parallel commands
