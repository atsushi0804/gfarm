Release note for Gfarm 1.2 (RC2)
================================

[2005.8.31]

Updated Features

 * UTF-8 support.

 * FreeBSD and NetBSD supports.

 * File locking support against replication during updating the file,
   which prevents from creating inconsistent file replicas.

 * A newly created file can be accessed by other processes before it
   is closed.

 * When copying, moving and removing executable files, only the target
   architecture section of the executable files is modified.  This
   means you can install and remove executable binaries in different
   architecture independently or separately.

 * gfarm.conf(5) - add client_architecture directive to specify a
   client architecture.

 * Environment variable

  - GFARM_CONFIG_FILE environment variable can specify a Gfarm
    configuration file instead of ~/.gfarmrc.

  - GFARM_ARCHITECTURE environment variable can specify a client
    architecture.

 * gfs_unlink_section(3) - new function to unlink a particular section
   of a file.

 * gfs_pio_sync(3), gfs_pio_datasync(3) - new functions

 * gfs_seekdir(3), gfs_telldir(3) - new functions

 * configure(1) - honors the --sysconfdir option to specify a
   directory of gfarm.conf.

 * gfsd, gfmd - accepts level N limited proxy to enable access to
   Gfarm file system from a process invoked by Globus jobmanager.

 * gfrm(1) - supports recursive deletion of (file replicas of) a
   particular file section.

 * gfkey(1) - the -p option is added to specify the term of validity
   in second.

 * Syscall hooking library

  - New syscall hook entries; fsync, fdatasync, pread, pread64,
    pwrite, and pwrite64.

  - lseek(2) hook supports a seek operation for a directory.
    (Bugzilla-ja #36, #37)

  - stat(2) hook fills 'st_blocks' in struct stat, which makes "du"
    command work.

 * Robustness Improvement

  - gfarm_agent(1) - the functionality is enhanced to accept all
    metadata requests.  When using gfarm_agent, client programs do not
    connect to an LDAP server, which reduces the number of connections
    to the LDAP server and CPU load of the LDAP server.

  - libgfarm(3) - tries to re-connect when the connection to an LDAP
    server, gfsd, or gfmd is broken.

 * Documentation

   - samba-hook, samba-gfarmfs - describes how to export a Gfarm file
     system to Windows clients via samba.

   - nfs-gfarmfs - describes how to export a Gfarm file system in NFS.

   - export-gfarm - summarizes the status to export a Gfarm file
     system in various protocols.

 * Bug fix

  - fix a segfault problem or inappropriate error message problem when
    Gfarm I/O libraries are called before calling gfarm_initialize.
    (Bugzilla-ja #32)

  - fix a race condition when multiple processes fix an invalid
    metadata.

  - gfarm_initialize(3) disables the syscall hook library.
    https://datafarm.apgrid.org/ml/gfarm-discuss-ja/msg00046.html

  - '=' can be included in a filename.

  - gfreg creates a file whose name is '-' when 'cat file | gfreg -
    gfarm:dir' (bugzilla-ja #35)

  - a remote file opened by a process can be closed by the child
    process.

  - fix memory leak.

  - gfreg(1) - fix a bug related to the -r option.

  - fix a segfault problem when using an old tcsh and gfarm_agent.

  - unlink(2) hook cannot remove a file with no fragment information.

   default file view for programs linked with Gfarm syscall-hooking
   library.

 * gfls - added the -a and -i options.

 * gfwhere - added the -s option to display the file segment size.

 * gfexec - shell script can be executed without "#!/bin/sh".

 * Syscall hooking library

  - New syscall hook entries; fchmod, rename, dup, getxattr,
    lgetxattr, and fgetxattr.

  - '/gfarm' is now translated to 'gfarm:/' not 'gfarm:'.  '/gfarm/~'
    and '/gfarm/.' specifies the home directory and the current

    working directory by 'cd' such as 'cd /gfarm/~'.  For more

    pathnames such as /gfarm/lib:/gfarm/~/lib in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

 * Bug fix

Release note for Gfarm 1.0.3.1
==============================

[2004.7.5]

Updated Features

 * Added new I/O functions; gfs_chmod.

 * gfs_unlink, gfs_rmdir - it now checks the permission of the parent
   directory.

 * gfrm - '-r' and '-R' options are added to remove the contents of
   directories recursively.

 * Syscall hooking libraries

   - Added system call hook entries for directory operations;
     chmod, mkdir, rmdir, and utime.

   - '/gfarm' is now considered as a mount point for Gfarm fils
     system.  This make '/gfarm:' and '/gfarm@' obsolete.

 * Bug Fix

   (gfs_hook.o)

   - Open(2) and stat(2) syscall hooks select the same file
     view. (Bugzilla-ja #26)

   - Stat(2) returns 0 for files that are created but not closed (by
     the same process).  Although this fix is not enough, Fortran
     program compiled by g77 can generate a Gfarm file.
     (Bugzilla-ja #28)

Release note for Gfarm 1.0.3
============================

[2004.5.25]

Updated Features

 * Added new I/O functions; gfs_mkdir, gfs_rmdir, gfs_pio_gets,
     gfs_pio_readline, gfs_pio_readdelim.

 * gfrmdir - it terminates very quickly. (Bugzilla-ja #20)

 * gfstat - it also displays the information of assumed fragment
     number. (Bugzilla-ja #16)

 * gfexec - The way to pass node number and other information to a
     gfarm process is changed again to be able to be inherited by any
     child process.  This has a side effect that all gfarm
     applications need to be re-compiled.

     '-s', '-I', '-N' options are added.

 * Bug fix

   (libgfarm.a)

   - Fixed a segfault problem especially when using syscall hooking
     library.

   - Fixed a segfault bug in gfs_pio_fileno(). (Bugzilla-ja #25)

     readability of a file descriptor for a remote Gfarm file.

   - Fixed a bug such that a parallel process cannot be executed
     correctly, which was introduced in the version 1.0.2.

   name.

 * Supported OpenLDAP-2.1.X or later (LDAPv3).

 * Supported special characters; ' ', ',', '+', '"', '\', '<', '>',
   and ';' in file names. (bugzilla-ja #13)

 * Syscall hooking libraries

   - Added system call hook entries for directory operations;
     dgetents, dgetents64, open, open64, close, stat, fstat, chdir,
     fchdir, getpwd, and access.

   - Modified semantics of '/gfarm:'.  It is considered to be the root
     directory in Gfarm file system instead of a current working
     directory.  Applications do not assume '/gfarm:' indicates a
     current working directory in Gfarm file system.

   - Changed the way to pass node number and other information to
     a gfarm process, when 'gfexec' command is used.
     *** You do not need to modify application source codes any more ***
     *** to utilize Gfarm file system.  Just link with gfs_hook.o.   ***

     This has a side effect that all gfarm applications need to be
     re-compiled. Or, you may be able to use "-S" option of "gfrun"
     command, if you cannot recompile gfarm applications.

 * Bug fix

   (libgfarm.a)

   - Fixed a bug such that gfs_pio_set_view_*() occasionally returns
     the error message "Success" even when opening a file fails.

   - Fixed a bug of default file view. (Bugzilla #4)

   (gfs_hook.o)

   - Plugged memory leak.
