Release note for Gfarm 1.0.2
============================

[2004.4.9]

Updated Features

 * Added a new client command; gfwhoami --- prints effective user
   name.

 * Supported OpenLDAP-2.1.X or later (LDAPv3).

 * Supported special characters; ' ', ',', '+', '"', '\', '<', '>',
   and ';' in file names. (bugzilla-ja #13)

 * Supported case sensitive pathname comparison.
   This change has a side effect that all pathnames made before
   this release are now considered lower-case only pathnames,
   even if the pathname originally included upper-case character.

 * Syscall hooking libraries

   - Added system call hook entries for directory operations;
     dgetents, dgetents64, open, open64, close, stat, fstat, chdir,
     fchdir, getpwd, and access.

   - Modified semantics of '/gfarm:'.  It is considered to be the root
     directory in Gfarm file system instead of a current working
     directory.  Applications do not assume '/gfarm:' indicates a
     current working directory in Gfarm file system.

   - Added initialization and termination functionalities in 'gfexec'
     with the -u option.  *** You do not need to modify application
     source codes any more to utilize Gfarm file system.  Just link
     with gfs_hook.o. ***

 * Bug fix

   (libgfarm.a)

   - Fixed a bug such that gfs_pio_set_view_*() occasionally returns
     the error message "Success" even when opening a file fails.

   - Fixed a bug of default file view. (Bugzilla #4)

   (gfs_hook.o)

   - Plugged memory leak.

 * Documentation

   (INSTALL) Added the description related to OpenLDAP-2.1.X or later.

   (Gfarm-FAQ) Added section for performance tuning.

   (README.hook) Updated the description.
